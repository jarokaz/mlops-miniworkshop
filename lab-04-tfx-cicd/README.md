# CI/CD for TFX pipelines

In this lab you will walk through authoring of a Cloud Build CI/CD workflow that automatically builds and deploys a TFX pipeline. You will also integrate your workflow with GitHub by setting up a trigger that starts the workflow when a new tag is applied to the GitHub repo hosting the pipeline's code.


## Lab scenario

This lab uses the TFX code developed in lab-22-tfx-pipeline.


## Lab setup

### AI Platform Notebooks and KFP environment

Before proceeding with the lab, you must set up an AI Platform Notebook instance and a KFP environment as detailed in `lab-01-environment-environment`.


## Lab Exercises

Follow the instructor who will walk you through the lab. The high level summary of the lab exercises is as follows:

### Authoring the CI/CD workflow that builds and deploy the TFX training pipeline

The **Cloud Build** CI/CD workflow automates the steps you walked through manually during `lab-02-tfx-pipeline`:
1. Uploads the module file with data preprocessing and training code to the artifact store
1. Compiles the pipeline and uploads the pipeline to the KFP environment

The **Cloud Build** workflow configuration uses both standard and custom [Cloud Build builders](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/cloud-builders). The custom builder encapsulates **TFX CLI**. 

*The current version of the lab has been developed and tested with v1.36 of KFP. There is a number of issues with post 1.36 versions of KFP that prevent us from upgrading to the newer version of KFP. KFP v1.36 does not have support for pipeline versions. As an interim measure, the **Cloud Build**  workflow appends `$TAG_NAME` default substitution to the name of the pipeline to designate a pipeline version.*

To create a **Cloud Build** custom builder that encapsulates **TFX CLI**.

1. Create the Dockerfile describing the TFX CLI builder
```
cat > Dockerfile << EOF
FROM gcr.io/deeplearning-platform-release/tf2-cpu.2-0:m39
RUN pip install -U six==1.12 apache-beam==2.16 pyarrow==0.14.0 tfx-bsl==0.15.1 \
&& pip install -U tfx==0.15 \
&& pip install -U https://storage.googleapis.com/ml-pipeline/release/0.1.36/kfp.tar.gz 

ENTRYPOINT ["tfx"]
EOF
```

2. Build the image and push it to your project's Container Registry. 
```
PROJECT_ID=[YOUR_PROJECT_ID]
IMAGE_NAME=tfx-cli
TAG=latest

IMAGE_URI="gcr.io/${PROJECT_ID}/${IMAGE_NAME}:${TAG}"

gcloud builds submit --timeout 15m --tag ${IMAGE_URI} .
```

To manually trigger the CI/CD run :

1. Update the `build_pipeline.sh` script  with the values representing your environment:

2. Start the run:
```
./build_pipeline.sh
```
### Setting up GitHub integration
In this exercise you integrate your CI/CD workflow with **GitHub**, using [Cloud Build GitHub App](https://github.com/marketplace/google-cloud-build). 
You will set up a trigger that starts the CI/CD workflow when a new tag is applied to the **GitHub** repo managing the pipeline's source code. You will use a fork of this repo as your source GitHub repository.

1. [Follow the GitHub documentation](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo) to fork this repo
2. Connect the fork you created in the previous step to your Google Cloud project and create a trigger following the steps in the [Creating GitHub app trigger](https://cloud.google.com/cloud-build/docs/create-github-app-triggers) article. Use the following values on the **Edit trigger** form:

|Field|Value|
|-----|-----|
|Name|[YOUR TRIGGER NAME]|
|Description|[YOUR TRIGGER DESCRIPTION]|
|Trigger type| Tag|
|Tag (regex)|.\*|
|Build Configuration|Cloud Build configuration file (yaml or json)|
|Cloud Build configuration file location|/ lab-04-tfx-cicd/cloudbuild.yaml|


Use the following values for the substitution variables:

|Variable|Value|
|--------|-----|
|_PIPELINE_NAME|tfx_covertype_training_deployment|
|_PIPELINE_DSL|pipeline_dsl.py|
|_PIPELINE_FOLDER|lab-04-tfx-cicd/pipeline-dsl|
|_TFX_IMAGE_URI|tfx:0.15.0|
|_ARTIFACT_STORE_URI|[YOUR_ARTIFACT_STORE]|
|_DATA_ROOT_URI|gs://workshop-datasets/covertype/full|
|_KFP_INVERSE_PROXY_HOST|[YOUR_INVERTING_PROXY]|





3. To start an automated build [create a new release of the repo in GitHub](https://help.github.com/en/github/administering-a-repository/creating-releases). Alternatively, you can start the build by applying a tag using `git`. 
```
git tag [TAG NAME]
git push origin --tags
```
