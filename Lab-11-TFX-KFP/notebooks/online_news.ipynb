We're working with a variant of the [Online News Popularity](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/online+news+popularity) dataset, which summarizes a heterogeneous set of features about articles published by Mashable in a period of two years. The goal is to predict how popular the article will be on social networks. Specifically, in the original dataset the objective was to predict the number of times each article will be shared on social networks. In this variant, the goal is to predict the article's popularity percentile. For example, if the model predicts a score of 0.7, then it means it expects the article to be shared more than 70% of all articles."
