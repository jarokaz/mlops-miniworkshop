# Analyzing data with TensorFlow Data Validation

This example colab notebook illustrates how TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) can be used to investigate and
visualize your dataset. That includes looking at descriptive statistics, inferring a schema, checking for and
 fixing anomalies, and checking for drift and skew in our dataset. It's important to understand your dataset's 
 characteristics, including how it might change over time in your production pipeline. It's also important to look for
 anomalies in your data, and to compare your training, evaluation, and serving datasets to make sure that 
 they're consistent.
