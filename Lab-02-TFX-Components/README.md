# Experimenting and developing TFX pipelines in AI Platform Notebooks using Interactive Context.

In this lab, you use Jupyter Notebook to interactively configure and run core TFX components. Working in an interactive notebook is a useful way to experiment with and debug TFX pipelines. Although there are differences in the way interactive notebooks are orchestrated, and how they access metadata artifacts, the overall flow can be prepared and tested locally before refactoring to a pipeline for execution under Kubeflow Pipelines.

[Run the notebook in Google Colab](https://colab.sandbox.google.com/github/jarokaz/mlops-miniworkshop/blob/master/Lab-02-TFX-Components/tfx_components.ipynb)
